# Resume Analyzer

Welcome to **Resume Analyzer**, a tool designed to help job seekers optimize their resumes for specific job descriptions. This application takes a resume and a job description as input, analyzes the compatibility between them, and provides a compatibility score along with actionable suggestions to improve the resume for better alignment with the job.

## Features
- **Compatibility Score**: Calculates how well your resume matches a given job description.
- **Tailored Suggestions**: Offers specific recommendations to enhance your resume based on the job requirements.
- **Screening Optimization**: Increases your chances of passing the initial resume screening process by aligning your resume with the job description.

## How It Works
1. **Input**: Upload your resume (text format) and paste the job description.
2. **Analysis**: The tool processes both inputs using natural language processing techniques to identify key skills, experiences, and keywords.
3. **Scoring**: A compatibility score (0-100) is generated based on the overlap between your resume and the job description.
4. **Suggestions**: Receive detailed feedback on missing keywords, skills, or experiences, along with tips to improve your resume.
